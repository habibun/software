# programming-paradigm
Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features

### imperative
in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,
- **procedural** which groups instructions into procedures,
- **object-oriented** which groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on,

### declarative:  
in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
- **functional** in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,
- **logic** in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,
- **mathematical** in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem


**Imperative programming** is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program’s state.

**Declarative programming** is a programming paradigm … that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
