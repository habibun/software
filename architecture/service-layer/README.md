# Service layer pattern
Service layer is an architectural pattern, applied within the service-orientation design paradigm, 
which aims to organize the services, within a service inventory, into a set of logical layers. 
Services that are categorized into a particular layer share functionality. 
This helps to reduce the conceptual overhead related to managing the service inventory,
as the services belonging to the same layer address a smaller set of activities.
