# Microservice
In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, 
each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.

### Microservice in a Nutshell
- Componentization via Services
- Organized around Business Capabilities
- Products not Projects
- Smart endpoints and dumb pipes
- Decentralized Governance
- Decentralized Data Management
- Infrastructure Automation
- Design for failure
- Evolutionary Design
