# Model-driven architecture
Model-driven architecture (MDA) is a software design approach for the development of software systems. It provides a set of guidelines for the structuring of specifications, which are expressed as models. Model-driven architecture is a kind of domain engineering, and supports model-driven engineering of software systems. It was launched by the Object Management Group (OMG) in 2001

### Model-Driven Software Engineering in a Nutshell
- Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) is a software engineering
  paradigm 
- Models are considered as primary artifacts from which parts of a software
  system can be automatically generated.
- Models are usually more abstract representations of the system to be built
- MDSE can improve productivity and communication 
- MDSE requires technologies and tools in order to be successfully applied
- Various terms and approaches to MDSE â€“ Model-driven architecture, model-driven engineering, model-driven
