# Event-driven architecture(EDA)

In an event-driven architecture, a notable thing happens inside or outside your business, which disseminates
immediately to all interested parties (human or automated). The interested parties evaluate the event, and
optionally take action. The event-driven action may include the invocation of a service, the triggering of a
business process, and/or further information publication/syndication.
