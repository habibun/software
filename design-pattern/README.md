# software-design-pattern
In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.


### There are three basic kinds of design patterns:
- **Structural** patterns generally deal with relationships between entities, making it easier for these entities to work together.
- **Creational** patterns provide instantiation mechanisms, making it easier to create objects in a way that suits the situation.
- **Behavioral** patterns are used in communications between entities and make it easier and more flexible for these entities to communicate.
