We use the decorator design pattern to add new optional features to our code without changing the existing classes.
The new features are added by creating new classes that belong to the same type as the existing classes.


The problem
The problem starts when customers are given the choice to add optional features to their car, like high end wheels, a car rear spoiler, or a sun roof.
We wouldn't like to change the existing classes to include optional features, so we need a better solution.
