# Domain Model
A domain model is a conceptual representation of the major items that must be understood to build a system the customer wants. You can think of it as the foundational design of a system, but one that both stakeholders and developers can understand.

There are many ways to capture a domain model. This can be in the form of bullet points on wiki pages, or something much more formal. One of the most common ways is to use diagrams.
