# Layered Architecture
Layered Architecture is the idea of isolation of each part based on years of experience and convention. The Layers are listed below:

- **User Interface** The User Interface is responsible for showing information to the user and interpreting the userâ€™s commands.
- **Application Layer** Application Layer is the way we communicate with the world outside (out of the application domain).
- **Domain Layer** The Domain Layer is the heart of business software. This layer is responsible for representing the concepts of the business, information about the business situation, and business rules.
- **Infrastructure Layer** The Infrastructure Layer provides generic technical capabilities that support the higher layers and also support the pattern of interactions between the four layers
