# Domain-driven design


Separating DDD into four parts as a learning approach:

**Concepts:** Model, Domain experts and other terms that do not qualify as strategic design, tactical design and architecture I classify as concepts.

**Strategic Design:** Also called strategic modeling, it is a pillar of the DDD whose main goal is to define Bounded contexts, Ubiquitous Language and Context Maps along with the entire project team.

**Tactical design:** Also called tactical modeling, it is a pillar of DDD related to “Building Blocks“, which are Entities, Services, Repositories, Value Objects, Aggregates, Events, Modules, Factories, etc.

**Architecture design:** refers to the style of architecture you will use. You can use different styles of architecture (Hexagonal, Layered Architecture, CQRS, etc.) to apply DDD.


##### Benefits of DDD
- Flexible
- Customer's vision/perspective of the problem
- Path through a very complex problem
- Well-organized and easily tested code
- Business logic lives in one place.
- Many great patterns to leverage


##### Drawbacks of DDD
- time and efforts
- learning curve
- only make sense when there is complexity in the problem
